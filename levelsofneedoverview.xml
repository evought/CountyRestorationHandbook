    <title>Levels Of Need Overview</title>
    
    <para>The Level of Need is the planning time-frame for information in this handbook. Is this information
        geared toward dealing with a crisis in progress or for long-term improvement of the community?
        We divide the Level of Need into three categories:
    
    <variablelist>
        <varlistentry><term><link linkend="EconomicCommunityRestorationGoal">Economic/Community Restoration</link></term>
        <listitem><para>Work toward mid and long-term improvement of our own economic well-being and the
            well-being of our communities;
            making our communities healthier and more resilient in the face of change or hardship.
            Recognizing and promoting best-practices at the community level.</para></listitem>

        <varlistentry><term><link linkend="EmergencyManagementGoal">Emergency Management</link></term>
        <listitem><para>Dealing with the crisis-of-the-minute whether or not best practices are in place or preparation has
            occurred.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        
        <varlistentry><term><link linkend="DisasterPreparationGoal">Disaster Preparation</link></term>
        <listitem><para>Planning for and dealing with longer term, regional emergencies which might disrupt production,
            communications, or infrastructure for extended periods.
            Once again, when disaster strikes implementation of best practices and preparations will likely be
            incomplete, so thought needs to be given to improvisation or crash-transition.</para></listitem>
