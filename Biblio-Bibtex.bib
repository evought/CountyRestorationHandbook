	abstract = {This report is one in a series of emergency technology assessments sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The purpose of this report is to develop detailed, illustrated instructions for the fabrication, installation, and operation of a biomass gassifier unit (that is, a "producer gas" generator, also called a "wood gas" generator) which is capable of providing emergency fuel for vehicles, such as tractors and trucks, in the event that normal petroleum sources were severely disrupted  for an extended period of time. These instructions are prepared in the format of a manual for use by any mechanic who is reasonably proficient in metal fabrication or engine repair.

This report attempts to preserve the knowledge about wood gasification as put into practical use during World War II. Detailed, step-by-step fabrication procedures are presented for a simplified version of the World War II, lambert wood gas generator. This simple, stratified, downdraft gassifier unit can be constructed from materials which would be widely available in the United States in a prolonged petroleum crisis. For example, the body of the unit consists of a galvanized metal garbage can atop a small metal drum; common plumbing fittings are used throughout; and a large, stainless stell mixing bowl is used for the grate. The entire compact unit was mounted onto the front of a farm tractor and successfully field tested, using wood chips as the only fuel. Photographic documentation of the actual assembly of the unit as well as its operation is included.

Please note that this design is intended for emergency use: it can be damaging to engines for prolonged use (particulate) and there are better designs which are not so easy to cobble together. Since this report has been published, cars have become increasingly electronically controlled. On-board software may need to be reprogrammed or disabled to run off of wood gas efficiently.

	note = {<p>For purposes of the County Restoration handbook, two lessons need to be drawn from this and similar reports:</p><p>1) Citizens throughout history have needed to provide for their own defense during a crisis and general breakdown of civil order. This is easier and safer to do if some provision has already been made for neighborhood watches and neighborhood militias, including not only defense but also first aid and distribution of relief supplies.</p>
<p>2) When civil authorities do arrive on the scene, their first goal is often restoration of government (and authority) not actually relief of citizens. They often do this by attempting to put down and disband neighborhood militias (and even local law enforcement!) in order to accomplish this and before crime and looting has really slackened. This leaves citizens not defended by authorities and not able to defend themselves.</p>
<p>This means that it is critical to have neighborhood watches recognized by and working in <strong>conjunction with</strong> the local Sheriff <strong>before</strong> the emergency occurs. This leaves the Neighborhood Watch operating as an extension of local law enforcement and there is a better chance it can be presented as a <em>fait accompli</em> to FEMA or other authorities when they finally arrive on scene. Actively deputizing citizens operating local watches and restoring an official county-wide communications structure as early as possible maximizes this potential.</p>

Are you interested in adding wind power to your off-grid electric system, but have been put off by the high cost of equipment and installation? Well, now you can build and install your own wind turbine!Harnessing the wind can be a tricky business, but in this groundbreaking book the authors provide step-by-step, illustrated instructions for building a wind generator in a home workshop. Even if you don{\textquoteright}t plan on building your own turbine, this book is packed with valuable information for anyone considering wind energy. It covers the basic physics of how the energy in moving air is turned into electricity, and most importantly, will give you a realistic idea of what wind energy can do for you--and what it can{\textquoteright}t.
